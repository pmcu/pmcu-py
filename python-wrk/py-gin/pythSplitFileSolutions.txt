with open('words.txt','r') as f:
    for line in f:
        for word in line.split():
           print(word)      

If you want a nested list of the words in each line of the file (for example, to create a matrix of rows and columns from a file):

with open("words.txt") as f:
    [line.split() for line in f]

Or, If you want to flatten the file into a single flat list of words in the file, you might do something like this:

with open('words.txt') as f:
    [word for line in f for word in line.split()]

If you want a regex solution:

import re
with open("words.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        for word in re.findall(r'\w+', line):
            # word by word

Or, if you want that to be a line by line generator with a regex:

 with open("words.txt") as f:
     (word for line in f for word in re.findall(r'\w+', line))
